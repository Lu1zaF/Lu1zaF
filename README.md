# Hi there! It's Lu√≠za  :raising_hand_woman:

I love learning new stuff, which is what brought me here in the first place.

Just recently have started studying how to program, and so far I've learned a bit on HTML, CSS e JavaScript. But I won't be stopping :gear:



:woman_technologist: To be a front-end developer is my goal 

:woman_student: I have a degree on International Relations 

:woman_student: I'm also a Digital Marketing postgraduate student at FGV

:writing_hand: And have been currently obsessed with learning Korean, listening to K-pop and watching K-dramas, not that you asked...
